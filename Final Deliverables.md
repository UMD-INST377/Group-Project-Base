Description: 
The API we ended using was based off of Speed Cameras in PG County. Our visulizations include a map of PG county that shows schools with the speed cameras.
It also shows a logo of PG county as well. Our JS library uses our script.js. We added a few different edits to our CSS to present the map a little bigger. 
Our project is trying to help people locate the schools where there are speed cameras nearby and alert them in order to prevent speeding tickets.
