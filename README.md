# Maui Hotel Finder
# Description
The purpose of our website is to provide users with a comprehensive outlook on the hotels and restaurants available in the areas of Maui, Hawaii. We strive to include unbiased and clear data about the hotels including, but not limited to, room types and various hotel services and amenities. We aim to improve the ease of travelling and make sure that everyone is able to find the perfect venue for their Maui vacation.

Using a database of hotels located in Maui, Hawaii, our goal is to create an easy to use application for searching through these hotels. Users are able to search using keywords as well as filters. The application also provides a page for leaving a review of the hotel that is to be stored in the database.

# Future Development
In the future, we hope to adopt additional features that will better user interactions and experience with the website. One tool we seek to develop is as a booking options where users are able to go a step further and make reservations at the hotel and restaurant listings. Another feature would be a portfolio for each hotel that list the distance from nearby airports, buses that transport visitors, and even nearby attractions. We also hope to develop an API that provides updated weather logs and current events for the region.
Additional potential future developments include:
- Expansion on locations beyond Hawaii
- More reviews, pictures, and tools that aid in user engagement and interaction.
- Implementation of a booking function beyond restaurants and hotels (possibly transportation vehicles).

Much of our future development, such as booking vehicles, go beyond our capabilities at this time. To achieve this, we would likley seek partnerships with companies like Enterprise and National, and serve listings as a third-party.
