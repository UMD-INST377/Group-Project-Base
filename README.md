### Target Browsers
Our target browsers include Google Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Our application works with all working iOS and Android builds as all a user needs is a stable internet connection and the working link.

### API
We used the Tyler Data & Insights API for the "Crime Incidents February 2017 to Present" for PG County which. The link for this API is https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/wb4e-w4nf. The JSON dataset can be found at https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/wb4e-w4nf.json.

### Visualizations
We used Leaflet to insert a map of the PG County area with map markers for each lat/long of a crime's occurrence. We used the Express framework for Node.js.

### CSS Frameworks
We used flexbox methods, no external CSS frameworks. 

### Problem Solution
We are attempting to display a topographic representation of crimes commmitted in PG County for users to access. The problem we are trying to solve is to fill an information gap to a broader audience so that they can see where and when specific crimes occur to stay safe.
