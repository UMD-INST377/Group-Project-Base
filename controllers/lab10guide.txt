Jim's lab10 guide - for GET requests

1. inside this folder `controllers`
   create a js file for your sql statements,
   and then write and export the sql statements (see census.js)

2. inside the index.js file import your controller js file created in step 1 and add
   as one of the exports (ex. I imported census.js and added it as an export)

3. In apiRoutes.js go to your get request, and add
   code to call your sql statement and display/retrieve.
    (View Jim's /census get request in /routes/apiRoutes.js as an example)
