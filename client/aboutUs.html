        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="mission-statement">
        <p>It can be difficult to decide where to eat on the University of Maryland’s campus for a number of reasons. 
            There are many options students, visitors or other community members may not be familiar with. 
            Additionally, many of the on-campus eateries have various hours or may be closed due to recent staff shortages. 
            Through this project, we hope to design an app that provides users with all their food options on campus as well as 
            the restaurants’ locations, hours, and dietary accommodations.</p> 
        <p>While the decision of where to eat can affect virtually everyone, our group will focus on students because 
            we ourselves are students. With a busy class schedule, sports, clubs, and jobs, it can be difficult for 
            students to make time to eat, much less decide where to eat. Available time and the student’s current location 
            also play a major role in this decision. When using our app, students will be able to quickly find a restaurant 
            in a location near them with food that accommodates their dietary restrictions, allowing them to make a much 
            quicker decision in where to eat.</p>

        <p>Our plan is to use the on-campus food services database provided by the instructional team, which will supply us 
            with all the necessary data to populate our app and solve our information problem.</p>
