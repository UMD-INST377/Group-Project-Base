## Speed Cameras
Target Browsers for our project include IOS, Android, Windows, and Linux. Chrome, Firefox and Safari are supported as well. The latest versions of these browsers are optimal for this application.

(Note: Multiple different speed cameras in the data set have the same geographical coordinates recorded. We are not sure why they chose to record the data this way. As a result, only one marker with the information for one speed camera will appear on a location where multiple speed cameras have been recorded)

## What API did you use, link to the API
We used the Prince George's County Speed Cameras Data API
https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/mnkf-cu5c.json

## What visualisations does your project drive?
Our project drives a map visualization that uses the data from the API mentioned above. 

## What visualisation or other JS libraries does your project use?
We used the map visualization library Leaflet to create our speed camera map.

## What CSS frameworks did you use? What version of them?
We used the latest version of the CSS framework Bulma.

## What is your actual project trying to display and solve?
The project is designed to display the locations of speed cameras and any recognizable patterns between them. It's supposed to show how each and every one of them is located near a school and how they get thinner the further out you get from DC. We are also trying provide useful information to the residents of Prince George's County by allowing them to see what speed cameras are near their respective schools and what speeds they need to drive at in order to not be ticketed.
