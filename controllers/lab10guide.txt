Jim's lab10 guide - for GET requests
run 'git pull origin main' always

1. inside the folder `controllers`
   create a js file for your sql statements,
   and then write and export the sql statements (see census.js as an example)

   NOTE: for sql statements that take in arguments like put and post. Use : before the query parameters
   look at how my sql statements are structured 


2. inside the index.js file import your controller js file created in step 1 and add
   as one of the exports (ex. I imported census.js and added it as an export)

3. In apiRoutes.js go to your get request, and add
   code to call your sql statement and display/retrieve. (req.query gets the JSON object then you can access your args)
    (View Jim's routes in apiRoutes as an example)


NOTE: make sure put and post are working before you work on delete
work on each 1 at a time - learn postman
