          of entertainment. The majority of people turned to watching movies and TV shows. Many of these people scrolled for <br>
          hours searching for movies met their criteria, only to not find it and give up. This system will help people find <br>
          their ideal movie quicker and more efficiently. Movie Curation's system gives movie enthusiasts the ability to <br>
          use a filter to find movies that fit their desired criteria. Based on their input in categories such as genre <br>
          and favorite actors, we will sort through the movies in or database and be able to match their input with the <br>
          best movie for that user. This makes the process of choosing a movie or show much quicker compared to scrolling <br>
          through a movie watching platform and deciding on what "looks good" at the moment. <br>
          We are excited to be able to help movie enthusiasts find their ideal movie.
