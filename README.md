## Title
Music Data

## Description
We intend to develop a system that can assist users with inquiries such as predicting future trends, which genres and artists could be involved in the next big hit, when retro concepts will become popular again, and so on. 

When you open the application, you will be brought to our home page which will display the top ten artists and albums. From that page, you can use the navigation bar on the top left corner of the screen to navigate to the search page or the custom input page. The breakdown of our pages are as follows:

- The home page will have the top 10 artists and albums displayed. 
- The search page will allow the user to search for a specific song, genre, or artist.
- The custom input page will allow users to input their own music into the database.

## Target Browsers
The target browsers for our application are most, if not all, devices with web browser capabilities.
