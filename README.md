# INST377 Final Project | Movie Database
For the final project, we are developing a website that shows general information about tv shows. The website will provide different genres of tv shows. The potential genres are popular movies, crime, drama, and animation (the genres may change when developing the website). The website will also provide the ratings of each movie display. The project idea is feasible for a six-week time limit and it is a web-appropriate project.
