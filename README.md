 # UMD Dining Database #
 
 ## Project Description ##

UMD dining services is in need of a new system that provides students with the crucial information about what food is being served at the dining halls on a given day. Currently, students are unaware of food choices and their dietary and nutrition facts until they enter a dining hall. They have to use their sometimes limited meal swipes without even knowing what their options are. We built an application that shows the menus at each dining hall: "The Diner", "South Campus Dining Hall", and "251 North Dining Hall". Users can also see a map feature to learn the locations of each of these dining halls, and search which meals will be available at which dining halls.
