# Songs Database

## Project Description
This app allows users to edit songs, artists, albums, and genres to their playlist. By creating a Username and playlist name, this app keeps track of when a song is added or deleted to the database and by whom. It also displays relevant data such as top 10 longest songs, top 10 largest albums, and top 10 artists with the most albums. Finally we have also implimented a search bar that allows you to search by song name, artist, or album name.

## Developer Manual
link or in github similar to example
https://github.com/Berniez88/finalproject377:

The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.
Your Developer Manual covers:
How to install your application and all dependencies
How to run your application on a server
How to run any tests you have written for your software
The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do
This documentation should be written by the people writing those endpoints
A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
Documentation needs to be written in Markdown (MD) files, nicely formatted (they are legible on Github in a way PDFs are not on Canvas)
Documentation should be included to each teamâ€™s final code submission
