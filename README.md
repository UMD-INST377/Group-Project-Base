 # UMD Dining Database #
 
 ## Project Description ##

The dining hall is in need of a new system which leverages technology in order to provide students the relevant information they need on the food at the dining halls on a given day. Currently, students are unaware of food choices and their dietary and nutrition facts until they enter a dining hall, using up a meal swipe without even knowing what their meal is. It leaves UMD students uncertain of which dining hall will have foods that will fit their dietary restrictions and can leave students unsatisfied with their choice to go to a certain dining hall. Additionally, students are often unaware of the quality of a given meal, which can ruin their dining hall experience and lead to them wasting food and money.
