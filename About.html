                    This project is about how many speed cameras are stationed near the area around DC
                    and how they get thinner as you move outwards towards Maryland and Virginia. The cameras
                    are mainly stationed around school areas the most. By using the search bar, you'll be able
                    to filter out each camera based on school name. Some schools may have multiple cameras 
                    located near them.
