### Target Browsers:
While our work is intended to be used on a range of devices. Our visualizations will look the best on a wider, and bigger screen such as a laptop. Although, our CSS style sheet is prepared to scale down and adapt to smaller screens such as IOS and Android devices. We did this by implementing multiple “@media only screen and (max-width:-” conditions to gradually change behaviors with flex boxes and formats. 

## Our Project

### The Api:

For our Api we chose [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation). We chose this Api over options such as coinbase because of reasons such as ease of use, no authentication needed, wide range of information available, and because it was completely free with unlimited requests per minute. 

### Visualizations:

We chose to use [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for our main visualization which we hold on our home page because it shows data in a way in which you can compare how one coin is going to another. We were then able to allow the chart to update at the request of the user with a clock of a button. Also, on our second page, we used [HandsOnTable](https://handsontable.com/) to display data for trending and change in crypto currencies. 

### CSS Frameworks:

In the beginning we did consider importing and using a framework such as Bulma, although while formats in Bulma looked nice it was not as easy to use as we first thought. Instead of using a premade CSS framework we chose to look at layouts we thought looked good on the surface and build those on our own. This way of doing our CSS allowed us to really understand what it takes to design a html file in ways that we felt fit our ideas and visualizations. 

### Purpose:

Crypto currency has been around since the year 2008. Since then, there have been more than 12 thousand different crypto currencies added to the crypto market. While there are many platforms that show crypto data such as robinhood and coinbase, we wanted to create something that is not as overwhelming and something you did not need to pay for or create a new bank account. With our website you will be able to view current data cryptos that range from high and low in price. 
 
### Attributions:

While we worked on this project as a powerful duo we had our areas where one or both exceeded in. Prince was able to find one way or another to bring ideas to life through JavaScript. Daniel was able to position and manipulate what we had envisioned our project to look like with CSS and HTML. Although, we both helped on both the back and front end to achieve what our website looks like today.
