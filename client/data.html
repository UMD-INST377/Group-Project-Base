    <h3>We want to help people find restaurants in the College Park area that fit the criteria 
      that they want. For instance, how expensive a place is, or its rating. 
      This would help not only people who are new to the area, but also people who are living 
      in the area, and either want to try something new, or be reminded of the various available 
      options.
      This would be useful to anyone living in or visiting the campus in the College Park area 
      and UMD students. This could also be especially helpful for prospective students whether 
      they are in-state or out-of-state since food options are important considerations. It is 
      also useful for those who aren’t necessarily in College Park but in neighboring cities 
      as well. </h3>
