         <p1>Our group's project is meant to simplify the animal adoption process 
           for anyone trying to adopt a pet in the state of Maryland, as well as animal shelter employees.
           We are providing shelter workers with a concise and easily accessible resource to find 
           information on other shelters, animal availability, adoption records, and other employees. 
           According to the Washington Post, some adoption centers have seen double the adoption
           rates than pre-COVID.  Our app aims to centralize the animals of many shelter 
           databases into a single location. In doing so, we hope to get more eyes on these 
           animals and reduce the information incognizance and overload traditionally felt 
           when going through this process. We also know that some families have restrictions
           on what animals can be in their homes, such as only being able to adopt a pet that is a certain gender.
          At the end of the day some animals struggle to find their forever home and our app focuses 
          on those animals. By just adding your name and phone number to our list you can help give 
          these sturggling animals the homes that they deserve. Below is a snapshot of our team ready to make a difference!
