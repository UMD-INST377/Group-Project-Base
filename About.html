                    This project is about how many speed cameras are stationed near the area around DC
                    and how they get thinner as you move outwards towards Maryland and Virginia.
                    We are also trying provide useful information to the residents of Prince George's County 
                    by allowing them to see what speed cameras are near their respective schools and what speeds 
                    they need to drive at in order to not be ticketed. The cameras are mainly stationed around 
                    school areas the most. By using the search bar, you'll be able to filter out each camera 
                    based on school name. Some schools may have multiple cameras located near them. You can
                    click on the speed camera popups to display basic information about them like their address
                    and enforced speed.

                    Note: Multiple different speed cameras in the data set have the same geographical coordinates recorded.
                    We are not sure why they chose to record the data this way. As a result, only one marker with the 
                    information for one speed camera will appear on a location where multiple speed cameras have been recorded
