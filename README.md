## Information Problem and Solution
We worked with the Prince Georgeâ€™s County OpenData, and we used the Public Safety dataset in order to visualize how much crime occurs in the county, and where exactly it occurs. We want student and PG County residents to know where crime incidents occur in a map visualization so that they know which areas are deemed unsafe based on the number of incidents in surrounding areas.
