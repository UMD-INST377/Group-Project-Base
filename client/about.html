                <h3>lets satisfy your hunger with our list of many hispanic restaurants</h3>
                <p>At HispanicDC, we believe accurate, up-to-date information on restaurants is important. We are
                    objectively passionate in helping people who seek to dine
                    at one of the many Hispanic restaurants in Washington,DC by providing the information needed to
                    achieve that goal.
                    Our mission is to help people satisfy their craving for Hispanic food by providing information that
                    will allow them to do so.</p>

                <p> HispanicDC, was founded in 2022 by a bunch of University of Maryland students in their web
                    development class. These students had
                    a vision to expand on their hispanic restaurant database and bring it to life in the form of an
                    interactive website. </p>


                <h3>Review Policy</h3>
                <p> People turn to HispanicDC for searches that are critical to their quest for the right restaurant. It
                    is important that
                    possible consumers are able to find relevant information about restaurants that truly offer the
                    services they're looking for.
                <p>

                <p> HispanicDC takes steps to steer consumers away from misinformation. Our team makes sure that the
                    businesses that add themselves to this website,
                    which serves to assist consumers in finding the right restaurant for them, publish accurate
                    information and do not miscategorize themselves. Our
                    team carefully reviews each restaurant entry, making sure there are no inaccuracies present from the
                    services they provide down to their contact information. </p>

                <h3>Authenticity</h3>
                <p>Consumer reviews on a restaurant are created by consumers who have actually experienced services with
                    the reviewed restaurant.
                    At HispanicDC, we make sure restaurants are subjected to reviews of consumers who actually spent
                    money with them. We ask users who
                    seek to upload a review to provide proof of receipt to verify the authenticity of the review. </p>
