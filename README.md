# Description:
For our project we used the PGCounty API: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Finance-and-Budget/Spending-Information-for-FY-2021/rh7w-bmhm
We used a pie chart from Chartjs.org to display the spending amounts from 10 randomly selected payment entries from the dataset.
The sum amount from each agency is shown on the pie chart and below the visualtion is a ranking of the payment entry amounts by agency.
For our project, we didn't use any CSS framework.
