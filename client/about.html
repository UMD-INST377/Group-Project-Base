            Due to the extravagant amount of mixed information per song in the database, users who
seek neatly ordered, pertinent information will find this front end development as useful. We do
not intend to limit our website to specific user groups; however, our main user groups would be
audiophiles, and researchers who would like an user-friendly resource to access song data.
Furthermore, users who seek relevant song information through description searches that are
listed in the columns, they will be introduced to analyzed information through data visualization
that relates to each description for improved general understanding about the songs and their
descriptions. We have decided on this database for its familiarity on song browsing through
YouTube and Spotify that would help us analyze in depth about song compositions of the
database.
