Group 1 inst377 Project Fall/Winter 2022

# Project Description
Our site allows users to search different spotify artists. When you type the name of your favorite artist in the search bar a link and picture of that artist will pop up along with artists with a similar name. When you click the search similar artists button another section will pop up that will include artists that are similar to the artist that you searched. One CSS framework that we used was Bulma which helped us create a smooth page layout that was easy to use. Data visualization was performed in HTML, with JavaScript to inject data retrieved from the API, and CSS to clean up the presentation. 

# Target Browsers
The main target of our site is people that use the newest versions of MAC, IOS and Windows. Testing of the website and its scripts were performed on Google Chrome.

# API
We used the spotify API(https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
