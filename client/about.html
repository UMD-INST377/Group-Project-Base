                <h1>About Our App</h1>
                <p> Our web app, LitterMapper, was created to help residents of PG County stay informed about the litter in their district. 
                    Using data from the LitterTRAK API, our app allows users to see the locations of littlers on a map and learn more about them. 
                    This can help residents take action to clean up their communities and keep PG County litter free.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Why We Created This App</h2>

                <p>We created LitterMapper because we believe that clean, litter-free communities are important for the health and well-being of everyone who lives in PG County. 
                    Litter not only affects the aesthetic of our neighborhoods, but it can also pose a serious threat to the environment and wildlife. 
                    That's why we wanted to create a tool that would help residents stay informed about the littlers in their district and take action to clean them up.</p>

                <p>With LitterMapper, users can see the locations of littlers on a map and learn more about them. This can help them plan clean-up efforts, coordinate with their neighbors, and make a real difference in their communities. We believe that by empowering residents with information, we can help create a cleaner, healthier, and more beautiful PG County.</p>
