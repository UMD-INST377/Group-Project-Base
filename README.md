# Yearly USA Population

### Our Website: [Git Pages]:(https://kevjamer.github.io/Fresh3-Final-Project-USA-Population.github.io/)

## Our API: [Data USA](https://datausa.io/about/api/)

The Data USA API allows users to explore the entire database using carefully constructed query strings, returning data as JSON results. All of the visualizations on the page have a "show data" button on their top-right that displays the API call(s) used to generate that visualization. We did not use any CSS frameworks. Our project is trying to solve the issue of USA population statistics by displaying charts and data for the US population.

They have data across all states but the only free information was the national population per year.

The JSON data reads:
"data": [
{
  "ID Nation": "0100US",
  "Nation": "United States",
  "ID Year": 2016,
  "Year" : "2016",
  "Population": 32312515,
  "Slug Nation": "united-states"
  },
  { ....
  };

What we need:
Link to the Github Pages site where things are running
Title: USA Population Visualization. 
Our ideal target browers would be PC and browsers such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, etc.
