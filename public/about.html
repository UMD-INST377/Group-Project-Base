        <h3>About the Database</h3>
        <p>Asian Americans lack representation within mainstream American media, and they have endured misleading and often offensive portrayals of their culture, food, customs, and experiences. Asian American histories have even been omitted from textbooks and erased from school curriculums. Our database and website will promote cross-cultural appreciation by providing content that addresses these inaccuracies. The Asian American community cares about this problem. The 1882 Foundation wishes to  promote the narratives and works of Asian American creators as well as expand public awareness and appreciation of their literature and media.</p>
