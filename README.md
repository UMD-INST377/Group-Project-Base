Our title of the project is, "Speed Cameras by PG County Schools". The intented target browsers was IOS, Mac, and Windows. The API we used was the, "Tyler Data & Insights API that was powered by Socrata. However, their source was from the Prince George's county data website. The only visualization we used was our map that provides a location with a marker of speed cameras located in PG County, especially the ones that were near schools. With our CSS, we used Flexbox, that type of framework that we have used for our labs during this semester. We used to appropriately  place our search bar, map, and a place to show the results of the filter. Our project is trying to display the location of cameras around PG county. Specifically cameras that are near schools. Whomever looks onto our website, they can search how many camera are near a specifc school, and take caution when driving around those areas.
