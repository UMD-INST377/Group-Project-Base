## Target browsers
Our target browsers would be Google Chrome and its users since we build our website based on Chrome environment. Unfortunately, we will only provide Chrome web browsers as our target browsers. If our expected users was increasing, we would plan to make new target browser version of our website such as IOS or android application. 

## Description of our project
### API
We used TV shows API(*https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-main-information*) by providing TVMAZE website

### Visualizations
Our project uses visualize the ratings of the TV shows from our TV shows API by using bar charts that we created using D3.js library. To identify rating of TV shows to our potential users, we chose the bar chart as visualization. 

### CSS framworks
Our project did not use special CSS framworks, but we use CSS Flex and Grid to organize our elements on the website. In terms of positioning, the CSS Flex and Grid were absolutely helaping our design of website to present well without selector conflict/crash. 

### Actual project and solution
Our actual project was trying to display music recommendation with the list and visualization based on using Spotify API, but we changed our project would deliver TV shows recommendation according to our potential users' mood since the Authorization process of Spotify API is quite complicated. Thus, we solved to get API and fetch it to our project by using TV shows API instead of Spotify API. However, we are improving our website adding music recommendation features with TV shows recommendation such as recommendation OST based on TV shows by using Spotify API.
