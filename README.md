We chose to work with the Smithsonian API because of the categorization of the content
with the values allowing us to search for interesting facts or features.  We hope to find that their
database is well maintained and has more than enough data for manipulation and future potential
changes to our project if we find we must go in a different direction than currently proposed.

We chose this topic because we found this to not only be the most interesting API to work
with, but also due to our close proximity to the Smithsonian museum it would be beneficial for
college students to quickly find exhibits to assist with projects they may be working on.

We simply named our project Smithsonian Museum Locator as the main feature we will set out to do is a map.

Our app will allow you to see and explore what exhibits are currently available to be viewed
based on category. Allowing users to quickly find and plan trips to  view the exhibits in person.
The app will also allow you to see how many exhibits are currently at each museum location
visually for those traveling and with little geographical information of their current area.  Our
app will show the current most popular exhibit category based on exhibit count for users who are
tracking what is currently popular for the museum. Lastly, the app will show which Smithsonian
museum is most beneficial to visit based on category selection.

Planned Feature:
-Search
-Map
-Graph
-Filters

Our target users are students living in and around DC that are interested in Museums and all that they hold. The website would beformatted to IOS and Android to make it easier for people to use on the go.
