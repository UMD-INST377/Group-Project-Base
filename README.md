Web-Application Link: https://will16363.github.io/Group9-Final-Project-Endpoint/

### Target Browsers
Our target browsers include Google Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Our application works with all working iOS and Android builds as all a user needs is a stable internet connection and the working link.

### API
We used the Tyler Data & Insights API for the "Crime Incidents February 2017 to Present" for PG County which. The link for this API is https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/wb4e-w4nf.json.

### Visualizations
We used Leaflet to insert a map of the area with map markers for each lat/long of a crime's occurrence. We used the express framework for node.js

### CSS Frameworks
We used flex box methods but used no external CSS frameworks. 

### Problem Solution
The project is attempting to display a graphical representation of crimes commmitted in PG county to presentation for users to access. The problem we are trying to solve is to fill an information gap to so that a broader audience can see where and when specific crimes occur to stay safe.
