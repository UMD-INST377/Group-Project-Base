        <p>
          Our team’s site aims to help prospective college students during
          their college search and decision process. Users are able to search for schools
          within the BIG10 which align closest with their preferred school size, admission
          requirements, and other categories.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users can also enter schools of their choice on our site along with the school’s info
          such as location, average test scores, and other details. User  school
          entries will be stored in a separate schools database which consists of school
          outside of the BIG10. This separate user database is available for users to make
          their own contributions to our site.
