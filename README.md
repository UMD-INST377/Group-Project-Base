# User Manual

Use the navigation bar to access different parts of our web application. The main navigation consists of home, locations, restaurants, reviews, about us, and contact. 

## Locations

Search for a restaurant's geographical location using identifers (neighborhood, landmarks, descriptions) that will help you pinpoint it's location locations. A user must input a neighborhood name with the list of DC neighborhoods provided on the form and hit submit. The user will get results of "X" number of restaurants that happen to be in that specifed area, as well as helpful information to find its location.

The map on the right of the page will have all the restaurants present in the database represented by map markers, set by longitude and latitude coordinates. There the user can get a better idea of how many restaurants are within an area.

## Restaurants

Access a restaurants menu, contact information, restaurant hours and other services by accessing the drop down presented on the page. The drop down will present users with all the restaurants present in the database with a hyperlink that will redirect the user from the HispanicDC website to the specified restaurant. 

(Note: next to the restaurants name, their restaurant id is present which will be helpful when posting a review for the specified restaurant).

## Reviews

Post a review for a specified restaurant or view other customer reviews on a restaurant as well with the reviews page. To filter through the reviews to find a specific review or rating just input your search in the field and press load table to see your filter results. To submit your own review, fill in the blank entries on the form, hit submit and then hit load table to view your review as well as other reviews.

 ### To filter through the reviews to find a specific review or rating just input your search in the field and press load table to see your filter results
  
  # Known Bugs and Future Development
  ## Bugs:
  - "Load Table" button in reviews must be hit twice to successfully show requested results (one time click does not generate the table on the side)
  - The map in the "locations" page will cover up the form in views that don't have large resolutions (very sorry).
  - Upon loading the restaurants page, you may see a different style as the background for a couple of seconds before it subsquently reveals proper background styling.

## Future Development:
* Add more restaurants to the database/website, preferably make it more inclusive to other ethnic cuisines rather than just hispanic cuisines.
* Find a way to implement a login page, store user login information and make a legit, multi-functional website (implementing a cache).
* Enhancing the user experience by using friendlier colors for colorblind audiences (inclusivity is important!), perhaps also trying to implement text to speech for enchanced accessibility. 
* Adding restaurant names or addresses when user click on a map marker on the location page. In addition, perhaps turning the raw day into a json file so it can be hooked up to an api for fetching results. 

NOTE: These suggestions would be amazing to implement, some are too complicated beyond our capabilities this semester & with the knowledge learned in this course. We would love to see someone expand on this project and enhance it. 

AS AMATEUR WEB DEVELOPERS TAKING OUR FIRST WEB DEVELOPMENT CLASS EVER AND TRYING TO CREATE A FUNCTIONAL, RESPONSIVE WEBSITE, WE TRIED OUR BEST!!!!
