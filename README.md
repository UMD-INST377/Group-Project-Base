Our API: [Data USA](https://datausa.io/about/api/)
The Data USA API allows users to explore the entire database using carefully constructed query strings, returning data as JSON results. All of the visualizations on the page have a "show data" button on their top-right that displays the API call(s) used to generate that visualization. 

They have data across all states but the only free information wasthe national population per year.

  },

  };
