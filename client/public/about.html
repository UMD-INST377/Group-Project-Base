        <p>The main information problem we are hoping to solve is allowing users to find movie recommendations based on what they like. We will be using
            Netfilx's movie collection as a basis for this. Our main target audience is those who like using movies and streaming services who want to be able 
            to watch movies they might enjoy. We also believe those who work in said services might care about thos problem, i.e. Netflix and Hulu. It can also
            benefit those who want to learn more about machine learning.
