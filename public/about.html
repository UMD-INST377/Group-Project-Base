                    restuarants that are within the county. It also allows community members to add their restaurant suggestions that will be accessible to
                    others members in the community. With many different food options and choices we believed it was our goal to proivde a platform that allows consumers to
                    easily have access to different restuarants and their location when choosing their next meal. </p>
