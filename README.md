## Project Description

### Target Browsers

Our project is directed at a variety of browsers. Since we used Flexbox, our page is able to suit different browsers due to its ability to change size.


### API

For this project, we used the crime incidents API provided by the Prince George's County Open Data Portal. The data in this API spans from February 2017 to present, and it was last updated on December 9, 2022.

### Visualizations

Our project provides an interactive map visualization for users. This map provides a visual for types of crimes in Prince George's County, and where they occurred. 


### JavaScript Libraries and Other Tools Used

Our project primarily uses Leaflet.js for our map visualization component. 


### CSS Frameworks

Our project uses CSS Flexible Box, or Flexbox, to give our containers the ability to fill the available space. This framework is used to accomodate various display devices and screen sizes. 


### What This Project is Displaying and Solving

This project takes in data from the Prince George's County Crime Incidents API, and generates a list of 10 crimes, plus the type of crime and location, and displays that information on a map. The idea for this project is to provide a convenient way for users to visualize crime in Prince George's County, and have an accurate space to do that.
