# Maryland Car Crash Database
## Description
When someone experiences a car crash on a dangerous road they should be able to input the circumstances that surround that crash to hopefully warn others. A user will be able to use this site to input data regarding their crash that will be added to a statewide database. The database will be analyzed to more accurately understand what roads in Maryland need to be prioritized for  in the future. This could be due to factors such as certain roads being more susceptible to weather or some roads are poorly designed which creates more crashes.
