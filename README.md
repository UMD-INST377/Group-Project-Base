# NBA Data Website
## Description
For our project, we recognized a lack of data visualization when interacting with NBA data. The information in our database can be found in dozens of locations across the internet, but they are all text-heavy tables of data that the user must sort through. We solved these problems by providing a less text-heavy database format for younger fans, focusing more on visuals than tables and data.Our website effectively provides data on teams, arenas, and active players, supplementing user knowledge and establishing a means to gather and analyze data on the NBA.
