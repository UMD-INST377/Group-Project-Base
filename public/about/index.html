          The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of data visualization
          when interacting with NBA data. The information in our database can be
          found in dozens of locations across the internet, but they are all
          text-heavy tables of data that the user must sort through.
        </p>
        <p>
          The database we chose is from a group memberâ€™s INST 327 project. The
          database has information about NBA teams, arenas, awards, stats,
          games, and more. We chose this database for a couple of reasons. The
          first reason is that it is topical. The NBA season is just around the
          corner and so this modification to this dataset will excite those who
          care about the sport and attract others as well. The second reason is
          that the database has a lot of data. The data consist of data from
          2016 through the 2020 season. We believe that with all of the
          different data, we can reach many audiences with this database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the many audiences that we hope to reach with our project are
          fans who are interested in learning more about the NBA, gamblers/staff
          involved with teams, or those who perform predictions for monetary
          gain. Young fans who want a roster presentation with more images may
          also benefit from our project. Anyone who is interested in historical
          NBA data that does not want to interact with a text-heavy table of
          data should benefit from our project.
        </p>
        <p>
          We plan to solve the problems we have identified by providing a less
          text-heavy database format for younger fans, focusing more on visuals
          than tables and data. We will effectively provide data on teams,
          arenas, and active players, supplementing user knowledge and
          establishing a means to gather and analyze data on the NBA.
