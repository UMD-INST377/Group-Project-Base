# This is your readme
You are required to fill it in with documentation similar to that found in the Sequelize example for the course as part of your final project.

### How to use Markdown
Markdown is a text notation system used in Discord, Whatsapp and similar to structure pages without writing HTML at all. You'll be using it for your documentation.
* [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

### Requirements:
README (top part of your README.md)

Link to the Heroku instance where your application is live and running
Title of your project
Description of your project
Description of target browsers (iOS? Android? Which ones? Which versions?)
Link to Developer Manual
Developer Manual (bottom half of your README.md)

The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.
Your Developer Manual covers:
How to install your application and all dependencies
How to run your application on a server
How to run any tests you have written for your software
The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do
A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
Documentation needs to be written in Markdown (MD) files, nicely formatted (they are legible on Github in a way PDFs are not on Canvas)
Documentation should be included to each teamâ€™s final code submission.
