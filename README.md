# IMDb Movie Fans

## Project Description

    As movie fans, our team visited many big movie review websites. However, some of them donâ€™t have all of the movies or their information is outdated. And most of them don't provide an option for visitors to add or update their movie information.

    Our project motivation is to provide a website where people can find movie information, reviewing movies and interact with our database directly to add or update our movie collection.

    As one of the largest online databases of movies, we extracted some of the movie information from IMDb and stored them in our database and provided four ways for visitors to use our website. They can search movie information, providing reviews, adding new movies or updating existing movie record.
