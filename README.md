# Vinyl Records Database 
## Background
Despite the emergence of more "efficient" technologies, many people have still maintained interests in vinyl records. With the passage of time, records being damaged or lost, and the slowing of vinyl production and vending, it has become more difficult to keep track of vinyl records. While many rely on a collection gathered by the previous generation, or record shops that still exist in some places, it is difficult to manage these records without physically being around them. With and popularization of music streaming platforms and management systems, vinyl records could benefit from this technological shift. 

## Project Description
Our goal is to create a management interface that allows users to gather information on these records without having to be in-person. The digitization of vinyl records information will allow more people to view them efficiently and bridge the gap between accessibility and management.
