### Description of target browsers
Our website should work on all browser (although we have noticed it works best on Chrome). It is also compatible
with screens of all size, so the website can be used on mobile, desktop, or tablet.

### What visualisations does your project drive?
Our project uses the Charts.js framework to build a bar graph directly onto our site.

### What visualisation or other JS libraries does your project use?
Aside from Charts.js, our website uses no other outside libraries.

### What CSS frameworks did you use? What version of them?
We didnt use outside frameworks but we did get some styles from the internet to help us style our buttons and the drop down menu
that works as global navigation. Links to the websites can be found inside our CSS file.

### What is your actual project trying to display and solve?
Our project is more of a vanity website that has 2 functions. It can return random websites that result from your query which may be useful for doing research, and it returns the top 10 results of your query which may be useful for everyday searching. Our website also shows you the number of letters used in each result
which can be helpful for statistical reasons (trying to find the most used letters in wikipedia titles). In all reality no real problem is solved but the website is
pretty nifty and as simple as it may seem it took a lot of problem solving and trial and error. Hopefully, it makes someone smile!
