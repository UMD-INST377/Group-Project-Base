## Title 
COVID-19 Statistics - Maryland Counties

## Project Description
We wanted to provide Maryland counties and residents with a resource that would allow them to monitor the coronavirus pandemic in their county to help them make decisions. Our website will have information about 
* Population
* COVID statistics
* Vaccination statistics
* Vaccination sites 

The Coronavirus pandemic is an important issue that everyone must deal with as it is still evolving today. We want to give counties and residents resources that they can use that would help them make informed decisions about their health and those around them. A user will be able to navigate to these different areas on the website and quickly find the information that they need.
