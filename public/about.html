        <!--About Text-->
        <h1 class="center">About Our Information Problem</h1>
        <p class="margins">Spotify offers a phenomenal service for all types of music and music lovers. Recently, they have gone through a UX update that has made some of their 
            features more complicated to access. They have made their search page saturated with recommended genres and playlists that users may not want to listen to.
        </p>
        <p class="margins">We want to focus more on user curation by including user's saved music and making it easier for users to quickly access the new music they want, 
            such as the top charts, and their favorite genres. This will improve user experience by making it easier for users to find and access their own music quicker 
            than they could before, and spend less time trying to navigate within the service.
        </p>
