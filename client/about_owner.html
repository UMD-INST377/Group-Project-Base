            <p>In today's world of constant information production and consumption
               , it is a fairly a regular occurance for someone to hear a song on a
               station and miss out remnbering its name. Our music station database
               navigation tool seeks to solve this problem by better connecting station 
               owners and station listeners. Our tool seeks to provide music station
               owners with the ability to easily list the songs they are currently 
               hosting. Our tool also seeks to provide station listeners with the 
               ability to locate songs in a given station.
