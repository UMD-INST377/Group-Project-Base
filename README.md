# INST377 Final Project | Movie Database

## Targeted Browser
We mainly targeted users using Google Chrome. 

## Description:
For the final project, we are developing a website that shows general information about tv shows. The website will provide different genres of tv shows. The potential genres are popular movies, crime, drama, and animation (the genres may change when developing the website). The website will also provide the ratings of each movie display. The project idea is feasible for a six-week time limit and it is a web-appropriate project.

## Data API Source:
[The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US)

## Visualization:

We used chart.js to visualize our data. Within the chart tab, we have two charts. Our first chart displays the top-rated movies. Our second chart displays both popular movies and tv shows airing right now. 

## CSS Framework:

For our CSS Framework, we made use of Bootstrap. This allowed us to make our website look more presentable.
