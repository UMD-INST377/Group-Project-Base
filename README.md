# Clato
## Description
Clato is a site designed to explore common ansestory between species by being able to see the divergence between creatures through time provides an exciting and stimulating way to make scientific abstractions tangible & real. Our goal is to bridge the gap between scientific research available to the public on biology & taxonomy and intellectually curious members of the public who want to understand more about current scientific models for Life on Earth. Specifically, we want to create a visual index for the relationship between different creatures and how they play into frameworks that attempt to explain the history of life on our planet.
