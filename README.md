## Targeted Browsers
For this project we made it so that any user has the ability to reach this site through their web browser, no matter the device. 
This web application is geared towards being used on the Google Chrome web application. 

### Data API Source
[PG County Crimes API website](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incidents-February-2017-to-Present/wb4e-w4nf/data)
[PG county Crimes JSON file](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/wb4e-w4nf.json)

# Project Description
The information problem we examined is which sectors of PG County are the most dangerous and what crimes are more frequent in each sector. We wanted to solve this problem because it is necessary to know this information to stay safe living in College Park and if anyone wanted to move to this county, they could use this data to pick a location to live in that is the safest. 

## Visualizations (chart.js)
On our first page we have a bar chart representing the amount of each crime type in a specified sector.
Our second page includes a doughnut chart, this is similar to a pie chart, showing the proportion of the data. When a crime type is entered into the input field, the doughnut chart ouputs the proportion of the specified crime type in each sector of PG county.
We used the chart.js library to visualize our data.

## CSS Framework
There was not a specific famework or library that we implemented into this project in terms of styling. We decided to choose techniques we learned through our class labs. This was the best option for our data, making the user experience as best as possible. The main pages have the information styled with flexboxes, ensuring that page changes depending on the device being used to access the page.
