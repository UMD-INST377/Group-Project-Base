    <p>This site aims to help users with creating and editing various playlists. 
        Spotify does not offer an option to update pre-made playlists, so this site allows users to do so. 
        Users must keep the playlists consistent when using this tool, they are not allowed to place explicit songs in non explicit playlists. 
        This provides users to create playlists of songs that are not included in Spotify as well.</p>
