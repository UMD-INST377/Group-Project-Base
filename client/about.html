                        Volcanoes can be a scary topic to deal since they are seemingly unpredictable natural disasters.
                        Finding relevant information on volcanoes in one place is difficult and that lack of knowledge
                        not only fuels people's fear but it can also cause panic should an eruption happen.
                        Current websites about volcanoes are not user friendly or very appealing—making getting volcano
                        information inefficient and unenjoyable. With this website, we hope to make people more aware
                        and
                        prepared for the potential dangers of volcanoes.

                        This site is aimed to help scientists, researchers, and safety officials—giving them access to
                        organized
                        information about past eruptions and to help them identify volcanic hotspots.
                        There are lots of people who are unaware they are living in volcanic hotspots and are unprepared
                        in
                        the situation of a surprising nearby eruption. Having information about this could potentially save lives.
