      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        It can be difficult to decide where to eat on the University of Maryland’s campus for a number of reasons. There
        are many options that students, visitors or other community members may not be familiar with. Additionally, many
        of the on-campus eateries have various hours or may be closed due to recent staff shortages. Through this
        project, we hope to design an app that provides users with all their food options on campus as well as the
        restaurants’ locations, hours, and dietary accommodations.

        While the decision of where to eat can affect virtually everyone, our group will focus on students because we
        ourselves are students. With a busy class schedule, sports, clubs and jobs, it can be difficult for students to
        make time to eat, much less decide where to eat. Available time and the student’s current location also play a
        major role in this decision. When using our app, students will be able to quickly find a restaurant in a
        location near them with food that accommodates their dietary restrictions, allowing them to make a much quicker
        decision in where to eat.

        Our plan is to use the on-campus food services database provided by the instructional team, which will supply us
        with all the necessary data to populate our app and solve our information problem.

        The link to the food service dataset is here:
