    1. Our project aim to visualize the Spendings of Prince Georges County throughout the years. Our request from the API pull data from various years and graph them on a chart. This allow us to see what the budget is going to throughout the years and what we are spending the most on, who we spending it on, and how much we spenidng on them. This could help direct future spendings in the county. It could provide us what needs to be improved or is lacking in development in the county.
