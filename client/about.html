        <p>After a year and a half, the Coronavirus pandemic is still an important issue everyone is
          dealing with, especially as it is still evolving today. There is still heavy discussion about the
          restrictions and rules that were put in place to combat Coronavirus; this includes masks,
          social distancing, closings, and travel restrictions. Recently, the school year has begun with
          many schools returning to in-person instruction which only adds to the discussion
          Maryland counties need to keep track of the ever-changing pandemic to allow them to
          make decisions regarding the population's health and safety. Counties want to do all they
          can to get the Coronavirus pandemic under control to return to some state of normalcy.
          We are providing a dataset for Baltimore County, Montgomery County, and Prince George's
          County to see COVID-19 statistics and vaccination statistics in their county. </p>
