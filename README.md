# UMD Food Services
UMD Food Service is a website developed by Chandra Tamang, Spencer VarZandeh, Amy Sylla, and Casie Thomas. We created the website to make the dining hall's location and its menu items more accessible to the University of Maryland community members. A user could use our website to find food items and their nutritional details. Moreover, a user will be able to find dining hall locations and their opening and closing hours for the weeks. In addition, The website allows users to add new data and update or delete existing data in our database.
