    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Planning a trip to visit a national park can be daunting, let alone planning a multi-park trip. 
        Finding the sites and trails that accommodate your needs and wants can require opening several 
        tabs worth of research that will eventually get disorganized. With our frontâ€“end, we are hoping 
        to provide easy access to activity, amenities, and accessibility information to help aid visitors 
        in their trip planning process to national parks all over the country. Users will be able to find 
        information regarding must-see attractions, trails, etc., and create their own trips! The data we 
        will be using will be showing all the elements that parks have to offer. </p>

    <p>Our database will mostly be helpful to people who are unfamiliar with the surroundings and are looking 
      for a guide to help them decide where in the park they would like to explore. Anyone who is traveling 
      to National parks and is looking for a guide to help plan their trips will benefit from our system. In 
      particular, those with accessibility needs such as ramp accessible visitor centers or campsites will 
      greatly benefit as well. Other potential stakeholders include entities looking to fund national parks 
      and make them more accessible for all as they will be able to identify parks that lack certain services. </p>
