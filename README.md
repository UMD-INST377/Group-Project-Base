## Title
Music Data

## Description
We intend to develop a system that can assist users with inquiries such as predicting future trends, which genres and artists could be involved in the next big hit, when retro concepts will become popular again, and so on. Our home page will have the top 10 albums displayed. Our search page will allow the user to search for a specific song, artist, genre, or album. Lastly, our custom input page will allow users to input their own music into the database.

## Target Browsers
The target browsers for our application are most, if not all, devices with web browser capabilities.
