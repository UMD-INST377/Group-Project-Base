we plan on gathering data from the Yahoo Finance API to give users insights into
some stock tickers' finances. Users should be able to compare different stock financials using our frontend
website designed using HTML, CSS, and Js. Our stakeholders would be anyone who trades stocks and
wants to know more about the company's finance before making investment decisions. Our website will
serve as a tool to help investors make more informed decisions. We chose the Yahoo Finance API because
it is the most extensive stock API and holds the most financial data. Our front-end stack consists of the
selected web development technologies to make it easier for users to access financial information about a
company. The displayed data will include an interactive visualization built using D3.js to make our users'
research process effortless and comprehensible.
