# Congress Database
--- 
## Description
---
Trying to find certain attributes about congress can be a pretty tedious progress going through multiple webpages. This site is for everyone to use to find information about congress from
our database. To help users not go through multiple webpages, we have tables provided about general information of congress members, contact information, and internet profiles for people
to get into contact or learn more about congress members.
