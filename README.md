# Description
Trash Tracker PG County is a site which uses data from the LitterTRAK API of PG County,
and visualizes the data on a map using Leaflet. A chart of the trash records over the past 3 months is made using Charts.js.

# Usage
To use the site, click the "See Litter" button on the right side of the page, under "Visualize
Litter in PG County". You can then move around the map, and zoom in and out to see the litter coordinates.
15 items will be displayed at a time. They can be refreshed by clicking the button again.<br>
When litter is displayed, the text under the button will give more information about how many bags of litter it was, and which major watershed the litter affected.<br>

# Support
