# Vinyl Records Database 
## Background
Despite the emergence of more "efficient" technologies, many people have still maintained interests in vinyl records. However, the passage of time and records being damaged or lost have added difficulties to keeping track of their existences. It is also impossible to manage a collection of records without being physically present. With the popularization of music streaming platforms and management systems, the team believes vinyl records could benefit from this technological shift. 

## Project Description
Our goal is to create a management interface that allows users to gather information on these records without having to be in-person. The digitization of vinyl records information will allow more people to view them efficiently and bridge the gap between accessibility and management.
