            information design for young children wishing to learn about 
            United States presidents. 
        </p>
      
        <p class='are-medium has-text-white p-4'>Although this may seem rather benign, a quick Google search to find 
            relevant, easily accessible information about presidents, 
            presented in a kid-friendly way can be difficult. Our final website is 
            intended to contain a cohesive, simple, broad, attractive, and 
            interesting overview of all of the United States presidents in a fashion
            geared towards children K-8 and their respecive educators.

            <p class="has-text-black">On the front-end we used Bulma to style and create interactive components for the website.
              The website also uses Knight Lab's (Northwestern University) open source <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/index.html" target="blank">TimelineJS</a> to create the beautiful timeline on the landing page.
              TimelineJS requires you to have the data in a special JSON format, which we dynamically populate using JavaScript after getting a JSON response from the API. 
              The update page is connected to DELETE, POST, and PUT API routes to delete, add, and update records in the database.
              A special GET request is also used on this page to populate fields of existing presidents for easy reference and edits.
              This page uses responsive flexbox to tailor the content to different screen sizes.

            <p class="has-text-black">A REST (Representaional State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface) was developed to allow the front-end user to interact with the database.
              We utilized Node.js to manipulate the data for function and compatibility. 
              The API itself was made using NodeJS Express, and consists of various endpoints that allow the API to retrieve, delete, add, and update from the database.
              Sequelize to manage our database, which was created and maintined using MySQL. Our REST APIs were tested using ThunderClient. Many queries were written using skills learned in INST327.
              Special consideration was taken to ensure that the API could work as efficiently as possible, especially in regards to interacting with the database.
