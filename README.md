## Prince George's County Housing Violations

# Recommended Browser
We reccommend that our users visit our webpage with Windows 10/11, Apple iPhone IOS 14, and Macbook.

# Project Description
## Purpose
When someone is on the market to buy a home, they should be able to ensure that their potential home is free of any potential dangers. Our site will allow a user to search for the violations of certain properties. Our website uses Prince George's County's dataset on Housing Inspection Violations since 2014 to inform buyers on the current violation a property has.
## About the API
We used Prince George's County's public dataset on Housing Violations since 2014 at [PG County Data](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Urban-Planning/Housing-Inspection-Violations/9hyf-46qb). Our API is accessed strictly from the front end and the dataset contained data points for:
- Inspection ID	
- Violation ID	
- Property ID	
- Street Number	
- Street Name	
- Street Type	
- City	
- State	
- Zip Code	
- Inspection Date	
- Violation Code	
- Violation Description	
- Violation Code Type	
- Property Location
## Visualizations and Other JS Libraries
With the given data, we were able to visualize the locations of properties through [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
## Framework
The CSS Framework that we used for this project was [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), which is based off of FlexBox.
