- Target browers: chrome, ios 16, Android 13

# Project Description
- We chose the Map of Farmers Market Locations datasets from the Prince George's County
OpenData API [link](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Community/Map-of-Farmers-Market-locations/bfif-wvjj)
- Our app/visualization will compile the inventories of farmers markets within Prince George's
County so users can create a cart of items they are interested in. The app will return a ranked
listing of what farmers markets will have the most of what the user is looking for. Additionally, it
will contain the names, locations, times and websites of the respective markets.
- Our app/site will have a list or a carousel of items for users to search through when creating
their cart. The locations of the farmers markets will include an interactive map showing where
the market is.
- 
- The information problem we are hoping to solve involves farmers market goers, our stakeholder,
not finding what they are looking for or potentially wasting time and money going to multiple
farmers markets to get everything they want.
