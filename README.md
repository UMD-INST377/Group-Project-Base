## Farmers Markets in Prince George's County
### Dante Cavalier, Kaiyuan Zhang
We chose the Map of Farmers Market Locations datasets from the Prince George's County OpenData API. The Farmers Market datasets shows market address and website and products sold in each market. We chose this dataset because it allows us to compare which market has the most products, or which market has the produce that the other markets don't have. The information problem we are hoping to solve involves farmers market goers, our stakeholder, not finding what they are looking for or potentially wasting time and money going to multiple farmers markets to get everything they want.
