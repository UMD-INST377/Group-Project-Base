# Volcanic Eruption Database

## Description
Volcanoes can cause seemingly unpredictable natural disasters and there is not a current, user friendly website that provides the relevant information on volcanoes all in one place. The lack of knowledge of volcanoes not only fuels people's fear but can also cause widespread panic should eruption happen. We built our site to provide information volcanoes, display volcanic data, and allow users to visually view volcanic activity and add volcanic information to our siteâ€”all in a user friendly environment.

## Known Bugs and Future Development
### Bugs:
- Null/blank values in Eruption AOA and Eruption Category that needs to be handled
- Delete for Edit Volcanoes doesn't work. If you'd like a volcano to not appear on the page, delete all of the eruptions. The volcano itself must be deleted through SQL.
- Page currently only loads on mouse move
- Form submission page shows up even if submission failed

### Future Development: 
* Add educational information regarding volcanoes.
* Adding more informational charts.
* Adding more volcanos and eruptions, goal is to have a complete database
* Add an advanced search option with filters
* Paginate the home page
