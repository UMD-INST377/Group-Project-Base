# MyKEA

## Description
College rooms are known for not looking the most spectacular. MyKea aims to simplify the college room furniture design process by creating a web application that presents furniture based on user preferences. Pulling data from a database using Sequelize, the application returns results based on the criteria users select in the preference form and if users are not happy with the results they receive, they can visit the “All Products” tab and browse through other available options.

### How to use Markdown
Markdown is a text notation system used in Discord, Whatsapp and similar to structure pages without writing HTML at all. You'll be using it for your documentation.

MyKea 

When people go to Ikea, they are generally looking for a specific piece of furniture or multiple pieces that fit together. We hope to simplify this experience by creating a web application that encourages a more cohesive room design. The web application will recommend similar furniture to ones users have already selected while also providing general browsing for users that are unsure of what they are looking for. There will be options for selecting similar color schemes and styles. We hope to streamline purchasing new furniture with recommendations to new products similar to what is already chosen and new products in general based on their interests.

- Link to Developer Manual

Developer Manual (bottom half of your README.md)

The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.

Your Developer Manual covers:
- How to install your application and all dependencies
- How to run your application on a server
- How to run any tests you have written for your software
- The API for your server application (all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do)
- A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
- Documentation needs to be written in Markdown (MD) files, nicely formatted (they are legible on Github in a way PDFs are not on Canvas)
- Documentation should be included to each team’s final code submission.<img width="983" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-07 at 4 38 48 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78005557/117505854-b7289000-af52-11eb-9227-4ea15759ec15.png">
