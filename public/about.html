    <div class='description box p-2 has-background-info-light'>
      <h2 class='title is-2 has-text-weight-bold'>Our Objective</h2>
      <p>Our project is centered around the lack of accessible and effective 
          information design for young children wishing to learn about 
          United States presidents. 
      </p>

      <p>Although this may seem rather benign, a quick Google search to find 
          relevant, easily accessible information about presidents, 
          presented in a kid-friendly way can be difficult. Our final website is 
          intended to contain a cohesive, simple, broad, attractive, and 
          interesting overview of all of the United States presidents in a fashion
          geared towards children K-8 and their respecive educators.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class='title is-2 has-text-weight-bold'>Technical Specifications</h2>
      <p>For our backend development, we utilized Node.js to develop JavaScript
          outside of a web browser. We used Express as a server frameowrk to 
          develop our REST API's. We implemented Sequelize to manage our database, which
          was created and maintined using MySQL. 
      </p>

      <p>For our frontend development, we used Bulma to style and create interactive components for the website.
        The website uses Knight Lab's (Northwestern University) open source <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/index.html">TimelineJS</a>.
