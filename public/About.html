            <p>Information within the real estate sector can be a very daunting area to navigate. There are countless different metrics and attributes that would affect a person’s decision to purchase, rent, or sell property. Our web application will allow users to access a database containing a vast majority of these metrics so that they can better inform their decisions when it comes to navigating the housing market.
                We have decided to work with Shania’s database regarding housing demographics in Maryland. We found her database the most interesting due to the plethora of relatable information when it comes to first time buyers looking into buying a house. It would also be useful to have a website that would help first time buyers get a better understanding of the many factors that come into play when buying a house.
